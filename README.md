Merely a partial refactor of a smelly 3 year old code base, don't judge me to harshly by what's under the hood of this one.

# Notes to myself

Serve locally with:
```
$ python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```
You'll then be able to access the page from http://0.0.0.0:8000

With LiveReload, make sure `autoprefixer -m css/style.css` is automatically run after `LESS` files are processed.
